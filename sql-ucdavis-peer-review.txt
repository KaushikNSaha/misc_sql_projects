Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000 
iii. Category table = 10000 
iv. Checkin table = 10000 
v. elite_years table = 10000 
vi. friend table = 10000 
vii. hours table = 10000 
viii. photo table = 10000 
ix. review table = 10000 
x. tip table = 10000 
xi. user table = 10000 
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (id-PK)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id-FK)
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id-FK)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id-FK)
v. Review = 9581 (user_id-FK), 8090 (business_id-FK), 10000 (id-PK)
vi. Checkin = 493 
vii. Photo = 6493 (business_id-FK), 10000 (id-PK)
viii. Tip = 537 (user_id-FK), 3979 (business_id-FK)
ix. User = 10000 (user_id-FK)
x. Friend = 11 (user_id-FK)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id-FK)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
		Not really. Various factors must take role in this process. Gerald who has a fans number of 253 has a total review 
		count of 2000 and Gerald has been yelping since 2012 while Sara has a fans number of 50 with total review count of 
		1629 and sara has been yelping since 2010.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
		
		- For the city and category I choose 'Toronto' and 'Restaurant' subsequently.
		
		- SQL code for Restaurant with stars between 2-3
		
		select city, category, name, hours, stars, count(stars)
		From hours hou
		Inner Join business bus
			ON hou.business_id = bus.id
			Inner Join category cat
				ON bus.id = cat.business_id
		Where city = 'Toronto' AND category = 'Restaurants' AND (stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3)
		group by name, hours, stars
		order by 6 DESC
		
		- SQL code for Restaurant with stars between 4-5
		
		select city, category, name, hours, stars, count(stars)
		From hours hou
		Inner Join business bus
			ON hou.business_id = bus.id
			Inner Join category cat
				ON bus.id = cat.business_id
		Where city = 'Toronto' AND category = 'Restaurants' AND (stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5)
		group by name, hours, stars
		order by 6 DESC
		
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
		Yes. In one case 99 Cent Sushi and Sushi Osaka have almost similar distribution of hours but the formar
		has stars of only 2.
		
		Restaurant with 2 stars called '99 Cent Sushi' is open everyday from 11:00-23:00
		Restaurant with 3 stars called 'Big Smoke Burger' is open everyday from 10:30-21:00
		Restaurant with 3 stars called 'Pizzaiolo' is open everyday from 9:00-23:00 and sometimes 9:00-4:00 or 10:00-4:00

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
        -yes. they have different number of reviews. 
		
		-SQL code for restaurants with stars 2-3
		
		select city, category, name, stars, review_count
		From hours hou
		Inner Join business bus
			ON hou.business_id = bus.id
			Inner Join category cat
				ON bus.id = cat.business_id
		Where city = 'Toronto' AND category = 'Restaurants' AND (stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3)
		group by name, stars
		order by 5 DESC

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
		
		Yes. 3 restaurants are all in M5V area. One of them has 4.0 stars rating with the highest 89 review. 
		Maybe the food there is better than the other 2 restaurants. Although 99 Cent Sushi has a rating of 2 
		but it has only 5 reviews. 
		The rest of the restaurant are all in different area so I can't reach a proper conclusion.

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: Difference in average review_count
		OPEN: 30.8120670391
		CLOSE: 23.1463096016 
        
         
ii. Difference 2: Difference in average checkin count
        OPEN: 1.65261044177
        CLOSE: 1.25 
         
SQL code used for analysis(open):

		select avg(review_count), avg(che.count),
		CASE
			WHEN is_open = 1 THEN 'open'
			ELSE 'close'
		End open_or_close
		From business bus
		LEFT Join checkin che
			ON bus.id = che.business_id
		WHERE (open_or_close = 'open');
		
		-output

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
	
	I chose do to an analysis on "Finding the star rating of a business based on the attribute and business is_open status".     
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
    
	- In the attribute table I found the busniess with their attribute and value. Lots of business have their attribute present
	which is represented as 1 or 0. Sometimes they are presented with true or false statement. I guess people might have give 
	them stars based on the presence of the attribute. 
	
	- I choose to join the attribute table with business table to check whether the business is open or not. If the business is 
	close and have absence of attribute then the business status is Negative. 
	
	- I also chose the checkin table to check whether people are checking in the business.
	
	- After cross checking all the necessary row I found that 27 business name with a star count of more than 3. They have their
	attribute present. 
	
	- 5 business have their attribute present but got a stars of 3 or less.
	
	- 31 business have more than 3 rating while their business_status is Negative. I chose to use both business is_open and 
	attribute presence for my business_status. Maybe these restaurant are open and even without their attribute they are doing 
	well for some other reason.
	
	-- 23 business have less or equal to 3 status while their business status is "Negative".
	
	-- Burger King with 1 star shows 2 check in.
	
	-- Although none of the place have people checking in. Maybe people are more reluctant to check in because
	they have to share their loction.
